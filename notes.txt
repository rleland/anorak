Random notes

Basic eatures which should be implemented as they require expanding the architecture:
 - Monster attacks
 - Ranged attacks
 - Map transition
 - Saving state
 - Picking up items
 - Equipping weapons


 Cleanup todos:
  - change forEach to map etc where viable
  - change return values of e.g. List to Iterable if reasonable
